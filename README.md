# DNSC 6278 Big Data Analytics<br/>the George Washington University<br/>Summer 2019

## Course Information

  - **Instructors:** Marck Vaisman (marck at gwu.edu)
  - **Classroom:** Duques 255
  - **Time:** Wednesday 6:00-9:00pm
  - **TA’s:** Swetha Kalla (swetha at gwmail.gwu.edu)
  - **TA Office Hours:** TBD <br/>
  - **Course Description:** Data is everywhere\! Many times, it’s just
    too big to work with traditional tools. This is a hands-on,
    practical workshop style course about using cloud computing
    resources to do analysis and manipulation of datasets that are too
    large to fit on a single machine and/or analyzed with traditional
    tools. The course will focus on Spark, MapReduce, the Hadoop
    Ecosystem and more.<br/> You will understand how to acquire and/or
    ingest the data, and then massage, clean, transform, analyze, and
    model it within the context of big data analytics. You will be able
    to think more programmatically and logically about your big data
    needs, tools and issues.
  - **Credit Hours:** This is a 3 credit graduate level course. You will
    spend approximately 3 hours per week in class. It is expected that
    you will spend approximately 2-3 hours of outside classroom
    activities (required readings, homework problems, completion of
    labs) for each hour of class time. You will spend approximately 30
    hours in instructional time, and approximately 100 hours in
    out-of-classroom time.
  - **Learning Objectives:**
      - Operate big data tools and cloud infrastructure, including
        Spark, MapReduce, Hadoop and other tools in the big data
        ecosystem
      - Recognize and use ancillary tools that support big data
        processing, including git and the Linux command line
      - Setup and manage big data infrastructure and tools in the cloud
        on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure
      - Identify broad spectrum resources and documentation to remain
        current with big data tools and developments
      - Execute a big data analytics exercise from start to finish:
        ingest, wrangle, clean, analyze and store
      - Be aware of the responsibilities that are associated with
        performing analysis of large datasets

### Pre-requisites

  - Experience with Python and SQL. **Note:** We will use Python as the
    primary interface to Apache Spark, through
    [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html)
  - Understand programming concepts (flow control, input/output,
    variable assignment.)
  - Experience with git and GitHub

### Refresher Tutorials

It is highly recommended that you go through the following tutorials if
you need a refresher or are new to the topics of git, the command line,
and SQL. If these topics are new to you, you must take these online
courses before the course begins.

  - [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
  - [codeacademy - Learn the Command
    Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
  - [codeacademy - Learn
    SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)

## Books, Software and Cloud Resources

We will also provide supplemental materials (articles, links, videos,
etc.) to complement the books.

### Books (for assigned readings)

We have chosen several reference books for this course that cover
different parts of the material. We will assign readings for each class
from these books. These books are available on [Safari Books
Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/), and you should be able to
access these resources. Our understanding is that as a GWU student, you
have access to these resources.

  - Benjamin Bengfort, Jenny Kim (2016). *Data Analytics with Hadoop: An
    Introduction for Data Scientists*. O’Reilly Media. ISBN:
    9781491913703.
  - Bill Chambers, Matei Zaharia (2018). *Spark: The Definitive Guide*.
    O’Reilly Media. ISBN: 9781491912218.

### Papers

We have chosen several seminal papers in the big data space to
complement the book. The papers discuss the tools and history in much
more detail. Topics in the papers will be included in the final exam.

### Cloud Resources

You will be using cloud resources on [Microsoft
Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [Amazon Web
Services](http://aws.amazon.com). We will discuss how to setup your
account and environment in the first class session.

### Terminal and Command Line

You will be using the command line and terminal heavily in this course.
Please take a look at the following depending on your laptop’s operating
system

  - **For Windows users:** Read [this blog
    post](https://www.howtogeek.com/336775/how-to-enable-and-use-windows-10s-built-in-ssh-commands/)
    to enable [ssh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) commands
    on Windows10. Even if you have PuTTY or anothe ssh client installed,
    you will be using the command line.
  - **For Mac users:** Macs have a built in Terminal. However, I prefer
    using [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) as another Terminal
    application for your Mac. I’ve been using it for years and I love
    it. This is not required, but truly recommended.
  - **Linux users:** nothing to do.

### Credit Cards

You will need a credit card or a debit card to create an account on
Amazon Web Services. If you do not have a credit card, you may consider
getting a pre-paid VISA card which you can use as the credit card when
you create the account.

## Learning Activities, Communication and Evaluation

This is a hands-on, practical, workshop style course that provides
opportunities to use the tools and techniques discussed in class.
Although this is not a programming course per se, there is programming
involved.

### Lectures and In-Class Labs

Every class session will have a lecture portion and mosy sessions will
have an in-class lab portion. Lab exercises are designed to get you
familiar with the tools discussed in class. In these labs, we will work
through simple examples. The completion of the in-class lab exercises is
part of your attendance/participation portion of the grade.

### Piazza

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is
highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates,
the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching
staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza.

Find our class page at:
<https://piazza.com/gwu/summer2019/dnsc6278/home>

### Assignments

You will be given problem sets as homework assignments. The goal of
these problem sets is to use the big data tools to answer some questions
about large datasets. The problem sets will build on the labs and will
be much more elaborate. Deliverables from the problem sets will usually
include code written for your programs and the output produced.

**Important Note:** We reuse problem set questions, we expect students
not to copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their
answers. Since this is a graduate-level class, we expect students to
want to learn and not search online for answers.

### Group Project

Students will assemble into groups of 2-4 students and propose, perform,
and write up an analysis of a *big* dataset using the tools learned in
class. *Big* is defined as “a dataset that is so large that you cannot
work with it on a laptop.”

Details for the project can be found [here](project.md).

### Final Exam

There will be an in-class final exam during the last class session. It
will be closed everything (no books, slides, computers, etc.) You will
only be allowed to bring along with you 1 letter-sized paper of your own
notes (‘cheat sheet’), you can use both sides. The exam will be
comprehensive and will cover topics from the readings and in-class
discussion.

### Grading

  - Problem Sets: 50 points (5 individual assignments at 10 points each)
  - Group Project: 30 points
  - Final Exam: 20 points

Final point count is 100. We have no plans to curve the final grade, so
the letter grade will follow standard guidelines:

  - A: \>= 93
  - A-: \>= 90, \< 93
  - B+: \>= 87, \< 90
  - B: \>= 83, \< 87
  - B-: \>= 80, \< 83
  - C: \< 80

## Course Calendar

This calendar is subject to change. We will make make any changes known
in advance.

In the readings, “DAWH” is *Data Analytics with Hadoop*, and “Spark” is
*Spark: The Definitive Guide*. Papers are referenced by author and
title.

## Policies & Expectations

### General Policies

  - **Attendance and punctuality:** Given the technical nature of this
    course, and the breadth of topics discussed, you are expected to
    attend each class, to complete all readings, and to participate
    actively in lectures, discussions and exercises. Please inform us in
    advance if you are not able to attend class for any reason.
  - **Participation:** We love participation. Read. Raise your hand. Ask
    questions. Make comments. Challenge us. Acknowledge us. If we speak
    for three hours to a silent classroom, it is a lot more boring and
    tiring for everyone.
  - **Computer Usage:** You must bring your laptop to class to work on
    labs. However, please limit the use of computers and phones to the
    lab portion of the class and please refrain from other activities.
    **You may not use your computer or phone while your peers or guest
    speakers are presenting.**
  - **Email and Online Discussion Boards:** Please use the [discussion
    boards on Piazza](https://piazza.com/gwu/summer2019/dnsc6278/home)
    for questions about the course, homework assignments, technical
    issues, etc. Staff will be monitoring them and providing answers on
    a regular basis. Individual emails will not be answered except for
    special circumstances.
  - **Cloud Resources:** You will create cloud accounts on Amazon Web
    Services and Microsoft Azure. You will get credits on both platforms
    that will be enough to support your coursework throughout the
    semester. **It is your responsibility to manage the credits and
    resources yourself. If you run out of credits because you do not
    shut down your resources, we cannot help you.**
  - **Allocate Time for Assignments:** Homeworks take time, so please do
    not wait until the last minute to start them. Give yourself several
    days to work on problem sets. While the tools have matured a lot
    over the years, there are cases where you will run into unforseen
    technical difficulties. All homework assignments have been
    thoroughly tested using the technical configuration provided in the
    assignment and they work. *“It didn’t work for me”* is not an
    excuse. *“I lost my code because I didn’t push to github”* is not an
    excuse. *“It took me too long because it was the first time I’m
    doing it”* is not an excuse.
  - **Late Policy:** Assigments are due before class at 6pm on the due
    date. Due dates will not be extended, and late homeworks will incur
    a late penalty of 25% per day.
  - **Class materials are for class use only\!:** Please refrain from
    making your private GitHub repositories or any other class materials
    public.

### Open Door Policy

Please approach or get in touch with us if something is not working for
you regarding the class, methods, etc. Our pledge to you is to provide
the best learning experience possible. If any issue comes up, please do
not wait until the last minute to bring it up. We will work with you
individually to try to resolve in a timely manner.

## Academic Integrity

The code of academic integrity applies to all courses in the George
Washington School of Business. Please become familiar with the code. All
students are expected to maintain the highest level of academic
integrity throughout the course of the semester. Please note that acts
of academic dishonesty during the course will be prosecuted and harsh
penalties may be sought for such acts. Students are responsible for
knowing what acts constitute academic dishonesty. The code may be found
at <http://www.gwu.edu/~ntegrity/code.html>

### Collaboration Policy

  - **In-class labs:** you may collaborate with other students during
    in-class labs to facilitate collective learning.
  - **Group project:** by nature, it is a group project and
    collaboration is to be confined within groups. **You may not
    collaborate across groups.**
  - **Individual assignments:**
      - You may discuss ideas on how to solve the problem with other
        students
      - You may get help from other students if you are stuck and/or are
        having technical difficulties on steps to take
      - **You may not share code - this will be checked**
      - **All submitted code and scripts written must be your own - this
        will be checked**
      - **You must do all your work on your own cloud resources - this
        will be checked**

**We have a ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY.**

## University Policies and Support Services

### Religious Accommodation

Students should notify faculty during the first week of the semester of
their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious
observance. Faculty should extend to these students the courtesy of
absence without penalty on such occasions, including permission to make
up examinations. Faculty who intend to observe a religious holiday
should arrange at the beginning of the semester to reschedule missed
classes or to make other provisions for their course-related activities.

### Disability Support Services (DSS)

Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact
of a disability should contact the Disability Support Services office at
202-994-8250 in the Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and
to coordinate reasonable accommodations. For additional information
please refer to <http://gwired.gwu.edu/dss/>
